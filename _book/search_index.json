Higgins, MD, PhD, MSc 2020-12-27 Chapter 1 Preface Welcome to Reproducible Medical Research with R (RMRWR). I hope that this book meets your needs. 1.1 Who This Book is For This is a book for anyone in the medical field interested in analyzing the data available to them to better understand health, disease, or delivery of care. This could include nurses, dieticians, psychologists, and PhDs in related fields, as well as medical students, residents, fellows, or doctors in practice. I expect that most learners will be using this book in their spare time at night and on weekends, as the medical school curriculum is already packed full of information, and there is no room to add skills in reproducible research to the standard curriculum. This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration. Many learners find themselves wanting to develop reproducible research skills after they have finished their training, and after they have become comfortable with their clinical role. This is the time when they identify and want to address problems faced by patients in their practice with the data they have before them. This book is for you. 1.2 Prerequisites Thank you for giving this e-book a try. This is designed for physicians or others analyzing health data who are interested in pursuing this field using the R computer language. We will assume that: You have access to a computer You have access to the internet You can download and install software from the internet to your computer How to download and install R and RStudio will be addressed, step by step, in Chapter 2. 1.3 The Spiral of Success Structure This book is structured on the concept of a “spiral of success”, with readers learning about topics like data visualization, data wrangling, data modeling, reproducible research, and communication of results in repeated passes. These will initially be at a superficial level, and at each pass of the spiral, will provide increasing depth and complexity. This means that the chapters on data wrangling will not all be together, nor the chapters on data visualization. Our goal is to build skills gradually, and return to (and remind students of) their previously built skills in one area and to add to them. The eventual goal is for learners to be able to produce, document, and communicate reproducible research to their community. 1.4 Motivation for this Book Most medical people who learn R to do their own data analysis do it on their own time. They rarely have time for a semester-long course, and their clinical schedules usually will not allow it. Fortunately, a lot of people learn R on their own, and there is a strong and supportive R Community to help new learners. A 2019 Twitter survey conducted by @RLadies found that more than half of respondents were largely self-taught, from books and online resources. There are a lot of good resources for learning R, so why one more? In part, because the needs of a medical audience are often different. There are distinct needs for protecting health information, generating a descriptive Table One, using secure data tools like REDCap, and creating standard medical journal and meeting output in Word, Powerpoint, and poster formats. More and more, all science is becoming data science. We are able to track patients, their test results, and even the individual pixels (voxels) of their CT scans electronically, and use those data points to develop new knowledge. While one could argue that health care workers should collect data and bring it to trained statisticians, this does not work nearly as well as you might expect. Most academic statisticians are incentivized to develop new statistical methods, and are not very interested (nor incentivized) to do the hand-holding required to wrangle messy clinical data into a manuscript. There also are simply not enough statisticians to meet the needs of medical science. Having clinicians on the front lines with some data science training makes a big difference, whether in 1854 in London (John Snow) or in 2014 in Flint, Michigan (Mona Hanna-Atisha). Having more clinicians with some training will impact medical care, as they will identify local problems that would have otherwise never reached a statistician, and probably never been addressed with data otherwise. 1.5 The Scientific Reproducibility Crisis Beginning as far back as 1989, with the David Baltimore case, and increasingly and publicly through the 2010s, there has been a rising tide of realization that a lot of taxpayer-funded science is done sloppily, and that our standards as scientists need to be higher. The line between carelessly-done science and outright fraud is a thin one, and the case can be made that doing science in a sloppy fashion defrauds the funders, as it leads to results that can not be reproduced by the authors nor replicated by others. Particularly in medicine, where incorrect findings can cause great harm, we should take special care to do scientific research which is well-documented, reproducible, and replicable. This topic as a motivating force for doing careful medical research will be expanded upon in Chapter 1. 1.6 Features of a Bookdown electronic book 1.6.1 Icons There are several icons at the top left, to the right of the clickable RMWR link, that can be helpful: 1. The Table of Contents Sidebar - Click on the ‘hamburger’ menu icon (three horizontal lines) or the s key to toggle the sidebar (table of contents) on and off. Within the sidebar, you can click on whichever chapter or subsection you want. 2. This book is Searchable - Click on the magnifying glass or use the f key to toggle the Find box and search for whatever you need to find. 3. You can change the font size, font, and background by clicking on the A icon. 4. You can download the chapter with the download icon (downward arrow into a file tray) in PDF or EPUB formats. 1.6.2 Sharing At the top right, there are several icons for sharing links to the current chapter through social media. 1.6.3 Scrolling/Paging You can scroll up and down within a chapter with your mouse, or use the up and down arrow keys. You can page through chapters with the left and right arrow keys. 1.7 What this Book is Not 1.7.1 This Book is Not A Statistics Text This is not an introduction to statistics. I am assuming that you have learned some statistics somewhere in secondary school, undergraduate studies, graduate school, or even medical school. There are lots of statisticians with Ph.D.s who can certainly teach statistics much more effectively than I can. While I have a master’s degree in Clinical Research Design and Statistical Analysis (isn’t that a mouthful!) from the University of Michigan, I will leave formal teaching of statistics to the pros. If you need to brush up on your statistics, no worries. There are several excellent (and free!) e-books on that very topic, using R. Some good examples include (go ahead and click through the blue links to explore): Learning Statistics with R (LSR) Open Intro Statistics Modern Dive Teacup Giraffes We will cover much of the same material as these books, but with a less theoretical and more applied approach. I will focus on specific medical examples, and emphasize issues (like Protected Health Information) that are particularly important for medical data. I am assuming that you are here because you want to analyze your own data in your (probably) very limited free time. 1.7.2 This Book Does Not Provide Comprehensive Coverage of the R Universe This book is also far from comprehensive in teaching what is available in the R ecosystem. This book should be considered a launch pad. Many of the later chapters will give you a taste of what is available in certain areas, and guide you to resources (and links) that you can explore to learn more and do more beyond the scope of this book. The R computer language has expanded far beyond statistics, and allows you to do many powerful things to improve your workflow, make amazing graphics, and share results with others. 1.8 Some Guideposts Keep an eye out for helpful Guideposts, which look like this: Warnings This is a common syntax error, especially for beginners. Watch out for this. Tips This is a helpful tip for debugging. Try It Out Take what you have learned and try it yourself in the code box below. Challenge - take the next step and try a more challenging example. Try this more complicated example. Explore More - resources for learning more about a particular topic. If you want to learn more about Shiny apps, go to https://mastering-shiny.org to see an entire book on the topic. 1.9 Helpful Tools Throughout this book you will find code examples and demonstrations, and interactive exercises in which you can practice writing R code right in the book. Let’s explain how to use these demonstration flipbooks and learnr exercises. 1.9.1 Demonstrations in Flipbooks Flipbooks are windows in this book in which you can watch R code being built into pipelines, and see the results at each step. Each flipbook demonstrates some important code concepts, and often new functions in R. You can click on the window to activate it, then use the left and right arrow keys to go forward and back in the code, one step at a time. You will want to go through these slowly, and make sure that you understand what is happening in each step. You may even want to take notes, particularly on the function syntax, as you will likely coding exercises with these functions shortly after the flipbook demonstration. Take a look at the example of a flipbook below. Activate it by clicking on it, and step through the pipeline of code with the right and left arrow keys. Watch the results of each step. 1.9.2 Learnr Coding Exercises Learnr coding exercises are windows in this book in which you can write your own R code to solve a problem. Each learnr exercise tests whether you have mastered important code concepts, and often new functions in R. If needed, you can reset to a fresh code window with the Start Over button. You can type lines of code into the window, then click on the Run Code button at the top right to run the code and get your results. Your code may not produce the right result the first time, and you will have to interpret the error message to figure out how to fix it. Rely on the text and your notes and the demonstrations to help you. If you are stuck, you can click on the Hint button to see an example of correct code, and compare it to your own. If you would like, you can even copy this code to the clipboard with the Copy button and Take a look at the example of a learnr exercise below. There is a dataset piped into a series of functions (‘verbs’), with a blank. Fill in the blank with ‘p_vol’ (without the quotes), which stands for the variable prostate volume. Then run your code with the Run Code button to get a result. Practice using the Start Over button, the Hint button (there may be more than one - usually the last one is the solution), and the Copy To Clipboard button. When you get a table of data as a result from a code pipeline, it may have more columns (variables) than can be displayed easily. When this is the case, there will be a black arrow pointing rightward at the top right of the table of results. Click on this to scroll right and see more columns. A table of data as a result from a code pipeline may also have more rows (observations) than can be displayed easily. When this is the case, the table will be paginated, with 10 rows per page. At the bottom right of the table, there will be a clickable listing of pages, along with Previous and Next buttons. Click on these buttons (or the page number buttons) to see more pages of data to inspect your results. An important note on coding: you should always have an internet search window open when you are writing code. No one can remember every function, nor the correct arguments and syntax of each function. A critical skill in writing code is searching for how to do something correctly. This is not a sign of weakness. Professional programmers google “how do I do x?” hundreds of times a day. This is how programming is done. You will often search for things like “how do I do x in R?” or “how to x in tidyverse”. This is completely normal, and to be expected. You do not have time to memorize hundreds of functions, and you may have days or even weeks between coding sessions (because of your day job), making it hard to remember all the details from your last coding session. This is not a problem. There are lots of websites that can help you solve specific problems, as you will find in the How to Find Help chapter.

Don’t worry, we will walk you through this step-by step. 2.1 Goals for this Chapter Install R on your Computer Install RStudio on your Computer Install Git on your Computer Get Acquainted with the RStudio IDE 2.2 Website links needed for this Chapter While in many chapters, we will list the R packages you need, in this chapter, you will be downloading and installing new software, so we will list the links here for your reference https://www.r-project.org https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ https://git-scm.com/downloads 2.3 Pathway for this Chapter This Chapter is part of the TOOLS pathway. Chapters in this pathway include Getting Started and Installing Your Tools Updating R, RStudio, and Your Packages Advanced Use of the RStudio IDE When You Don’t Want to Update Packages (Using renv) Major R Updates (Where Are My Packages?) 2.4 Installing R on your Computer R is a statistical programming language, designed for non-programmers (statisticians). It is optimized to work with data in tables. It is a very fast and powerful programming engine, but it is not terribly comfortable or convenient. R itself is not terribly user-friendly. It is a lot like a drag racing car, which is basically a person with a steering wheel strapped to an airplane engine. Very aerodynamic and fast, but not comfortable for the long run (more than about 8 seconds). You will need something more like a production car, with a nice interior and a dashboard, and comfy leather seats. This equivalent of a comfy coding environment is provided by the RStudio IDE (Integrated Developer Environment). We want you to install both R and RStudio, in that order. Let’s start with installing R. R is free and available for download on the web. Go to the r-project website to get started. This screen will look like this You can see from the blue link (download R) that you can download R, but you will be downloading it faster if you pick a local CRAN mirror. You might be wondering what CRAN and CRAN Mirrors are. Nothing to do with cranberries, fortunately. CRAN is the Comprehensive R Archive Network. Each site (mirror) in the network contains an archive of all R versions and packages, and the sites are scattered over the globe. A CRAN Mirror maintains an up to date copy of all of the R versions and packages on CRAN. If you use the nearest CRAN mirror, you will generally get faster downloads. At this point, you might be wondering what a package is… A package is a set of functions and/or data that you can download to upgrade and add features to R. It is a lot like a downloadable upgrade to a Tesla that lets you play the video game Witcher 3 on your console, but more useful. Another useful analogy for packages is that they are like apps for a smartphone. When you buy your first smartphone, it only comes with the basic apps that allow it to work as a phone, but a notepad and a calculator. If you want to do cool things with your smartphone, you download apps that allow your smartphone to have new capabilities. That is what packages do for your installation of R. Now let’s get started. Click on the blue link that says “download R”. This will take you to a page to select your local CRAN Mirror , from which you will download R. Scroll down to your local country (yes, the USA is at the bottom), and a CRAN mirror near you. This is an example from the state of Michigan, in the USA. Once you click on a CRAN Mirror site to select the location, you will be taken to the actual Download site. Select the link for the operating system you want to use. We will walk through this with Windows first, then Mac. If you are using a Mac, skip forward to the Mac install directions. If you are computer-savvy enough to be using Linux, you can clearly figure it out on your own (it will look a lot like these). Once you have clicked through, your next screen will look like this: You want to download both base and Rtools (you might need Rtools later). The base link will take you to the latest version, which will look something like this. Click on this link, and you will be able to save a file named R-N.N.N-win.exe (Ns depending on version number) to your Downloads folder. Click on the Save button to save it. Now, go to your Downloads folder in Windows, and double click on the R installation file (R-N.N.N-win.exe). Click Yes to allow this to install. Now select your language option. You will be asked to accept the GNU license - do so. Click Yes to allow this to install. Then select where to install - generally use the default- a local (often C) drive - do not install on a shared network drive or in the cloud. Then select the Components - generally use the defaults, but newer computers can skip the 32 bit version. In the next dialog box, accept the default startup options. You can choose the start menu folder. The default R folder is fine. You probably won’t need shortcuts, so leave these unchecked in the next dialog box. Then the Setup Wizard will appear - click Finish, and the rest of the installation will occur. install_wizard 2.4.1 Testing Now you want to test whether your Windows installation was successful. Can you find R and make it work? Hunt for your C folder, then for OS-APPS within that folder. Keep drilling down to the Program Files folder. Then the R folder, and the current version folder within that one (R-N.N.N). Within that folder will be the bin folder, and within that will be your R-N.N.N.exe file. Double click on this to run it. The example paths below can help guide you. Opening the exe file will produce a classic 2000-era terminal window, called Rterm, with 64 bit if that is what your computer uses. The version number should match what you downloaded. The messaging should end with a “&gt;” prompt. At this prompt, type in: paste(‘Two to the seventh power is’, 2^7) (don’t leave out the comma) - then press the Enter key. This should produce the following: Note that you have explained what is being done and computed the result. 2.4.2 Mac Install of R The installation for Mac is very similar, but the windows look a bit different. At the Download Version page, you click on the Mac Download. You will then click on the link for R-N.N.N.pkg, and allow downloads from CRAN. Then go to Finder, and navigate to the Downloads folder. Click on R-N.N.N.pkg You will then click on the link for R-N.N.N.pkg, and allow downloads from CRAN. Click on Continue on 2 consecutive screens to download cont2_mac Then you need to agree with the License Agreement, then Click on Install, and provide your Mac password for permission to install. When the installation is complete, click on the Close button. Accept the prompt to move the installer file to the trash. 2.4.3 Testing R on the Mac Go to Finder, and then your Applications folder. Scroll down to the R file. Double click on this to run it. You should get this 2000-era terminal window named R Console. The version number should match what you downloaded, and the messaging should end with a “&gt;” prompt. At this prompt, type in paste(“Two to the seventh power is”, 2^7) (DON’T leave out the comma or the quotes) This should result in 2.4.4 Successful testing! Awesome. You are now Ready to R! 2.5 Installing RStudio on your Computer Now that R is working, we will install RStudio. This is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), with lots of bells and whistles to help you do reproducible medical research. This is a lot like adding a dashboard with polished walnut panels, a large video screen map, and heated car seats with Corinthian Leather. Not absolutely necessary, but nice to have. The RStudio IDE wraps around the R engine to make your experience more comfortable and efficient. Fortunately, RStudio is a lot cheaper than any of these cars. In fact, it is free and open source. You can download it from the web at: rstudio Click on the RStudio Desktop icon to begin. This will take you to a new site, where you will select the Open Source Edition of RStudio Desktop This will take you to a new site, where you will select the Free Version of RStudio Desktop Now select the right version for your Operating syxtem - Windows or Mac. 2.5.1 Windows Install Now save the Rstudio.N.N.N.exe file (Ns will be digits representing the version number) to your downloads folder. Now go to your downloads folder, and double click on the Rstudio.N.N.N.exe file. Allow this app to make changes. Click Next to Continue, and Agree to the Install Location. Click Install to put Rstudio in the default Start Menu Folder, and when done, click the Finish button. Now select your preferred language option, accept the GNU license, Click Yes to allow this to install. Select where to install. This is generally on a local (often C:) drive, and usually not a shared network drive or in the cloud. 2.5.2 Testing Windows RStudio Now you should be ready to test your Windows installation of Rstudio. Open your Start menu Program list, and find Rstudio. Pin it as a favorite now. Click to Open Rstudio. Within the Console window of Rstudio, an instance of R is started up. Check that the version number matches the version of R that you downloaded. Now run a test at the prompt (“&gt;”) in the Console window. Type in paste(\"Three to the 5th power is\", 3^5) do not leave out the quotes or the comma Then press the enter key and this should be your result: A successful result means that you are ready to roll in Rstudio and R! 2.5.3 Installing RStudio on the Mac Start at this link: Rstudio Download Select the Free RStudio Desktop Version Then click on the big button to Download RStudio for Mac. After the Download is complete, go to Finder and the Downloads Folder. Double click on the Rstudio.N.N.N.dmg file in your Downloads folder. This will open a window that looks like this Use your mouse to drag the RStudio icon into the Applications folder. Now go back to Finder, then into the Applications folder. Double click on the RStudio icon, and click OK to Open. Pin your RStudio to the Dock. Double Click to run RStudio. RStudio will open an instance of R inside the Console pane of RStudio with the version number of R that you installed, and a “&gt;” prompt. 2.5.4 Testing the Mac Installation of RStudio Type in paste(\"Three to the 5th power is\", 3^5) do not leave out the quotes or the comma Then press the enter key and this should be your result. A successful result means that you are ready to roll in Rstudio and R! 2.6 Critical Setup - Tuning Your RStudio We have 6+ adjustments that we need to make in your RStudio Global Settings for optimal R and RStudio use. At this point, it is a good idea to jump out of RStudio and create an “Rcode” folder on your computer, in a place that is easy to find, often at the top level in your Documents folder, to make all of your future projects easy to find. Once that is in place, switch back to RStudio. In the RStudio Menus, go to Tools/Global Options. A new Global Options window will open up. Click on the General tab on the left. At the top, there is a small window for identifying your Default working directory. Click on the Browse button, and browse to your new “Rcode” folder and select it. From now on, your R files and Projects will all be in one place and easy to find. In the same General tab, de-select the first 3 options turn off Restore most recently opened project at startup turn off Restore previously open source documents at startup turn off Restore .RData into workspace In the same General tab, find Save workspace to .RData on exit. Click on the dropdown menu to select “Never” These tune-ups (#2 and #3) to your RStudio will mean you will always start with a clean workspace in a new RStudio session, which will avoid a lot of potential problems later. In the same General tab, at the top, click on the Advanced tab. Then select the box for Show full path to project in window title This will show your working directory at the top of your Console Pane. This can prevent confusion and problems later. On the left, click on the Rmarkdown tab. Then de-select the option for Show output inline for all Rmarkdown documents. This will put your temporary output from Code Chunks into the larger and nicer Viewer tab. Take a look at the Appearance tab. You can change your code font, the font size, and the theme. I wouldn’t make any drastic changes at this point, but it is good to know that these options are available. Any changes here are entirely optional (and cosmetic) at this point. in the RStudio menus, select Code, then check/select two options to turn these on: Soft Wrap Long Lines - so that your code does not get too wide Rainbow Parentheses - color-codes parentheses so that you can keep track of whether you have closed all of your open parentheses (a common source of errors) 2.7 Installing Git on your Computer 2.8 Getting Acquainted with the RStudio IDE When you first open the RStudio IDE (Integrated Development Environment), there will be a left side pane, with tabs for Console, Terminal, Rmarkdown, and Jobs. Just for fun, go to the RStudio menus, and choose File/New File/RScript. This will open a new pane at the top left, which we will call Q1 (quadrant 1), or the top left pane, or the Source pane. This pane will contain tabs for each active script or document, along with tabs for any datasets you have opened up to have a look at. The Quadrant 2 pane, with tabs for Console, Terminal, Rmarkdown, and Jobs, has now been pushed to the lower right pane. You will use the Console for interactive programming, and as a “sandbox” to test out new code. When your code works and is good enough to save, you will move it to the Source pane and save it to a Script or an Rmarkdown document. Any code that is not saved to Source will be lost (actually it will be somewhere in the History, but it can be a pain to find the version that works later - best to save the good stuff to a Script or .Rmd). The Quadrant 3, or top right pane, includes tabs for your Environment (objects, like datasets, functions, and variables you have defined), History (saving the past in case you forget to, but messy), and Connections tabs for connections to databases. Later a Git tab will be added for version control (backup) of your Source documents. In Quadrant 4, or the bottom right pane, you will find tabs for your Files, Plots, Packages, Help, and a Viewer for HTML output. This is material that is also well described in the “Basic Basics 1” section of RLadiesSydney. Check it out at BasicBasics1. There is a nice ~ 15 minute video by Jen Richmond.

Chapters in this pathway include 3.6 Open a New Rmarkdown document Let’s get started in R. Turn on your computer, and open the RStudio application. You should see the familiar panes for the Console, Environment, and Files. You need to open up a new document to activate the Source pane. While in RStudio, click on File/New File/R Script. It should look like this. Now you will see the window below. Rename the document from “Untitled” to “Tasting”, and click the OK button. Now the file is open, and looks like the window below. Click on the save icon (like a floppy disk in the top left), and save this document as tasting.Rmd. You have created a new Rmarkdown document. An Rmarkdown document lets you mix data, code, and descriptive text. It is very helpful for presenting and explaining data and visualizations. An Rmarkdown document can be converted (Knit) to HTML for a web page, Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, PDF, and several other formats. Code chunks are in a gray color, and both start and end with 3 backticks (```). Text can be body text, or can be headers and titles. The number of hashtags before some header text defines what level the header is. You can insert links, pictures, and YouTube videos into Rmarkdown documents if it is helpful to explain your point. The first code chunk in each Rmarkdown document is named setup. The name comes after the left curly brace and the r ({r) at the beginning of the setup chunk. The letter r tells RStudio that what is coming on the next line is R code (RStudio can also use SQL, C++, python, and several other languages). After the comma, you can define options for this code chunk. In this case, the option include is set to FALSE, so that when this Rmarkdown document is knitted, this code chunk will not appear. 3.7 Read in Data from a file 3.8 Wrangle Your Data 3.9 Visualize Your Data 3.10 Publish your work to RPubs 3.11 The Dessert Cart Below are some examples of neat things you can do with medical data in R.

Often combining bits of several packages leads to emergent properties - completely new creations that can only occur because all of the parts (packages) are present. The collaborative nature of the R community, in this case on Twitter (follow the #rstats hashtag), can lead to surprising collaborations and outcomes. Go ahead and play the example below, which uses rayrendering (all coded entirely in R) to show a 3D map of John Snow’s cholera case data in 1854, which led him to identify the Broad Street water pump as the source of the cholera outbreak, and led to the removal of the pump handle and the end of outbreak. ## Warning in knitr::write_bib(&quot;rayrender&quot;, &quot;packages.bib&quot;): ## package(s) rayrender not found "],["wrangling-rows-in-r-with-filter.html", "Chapter 4 Wrangling Rows in R with Filter 4.1 Filtering on Numbers - Starting with A Flipbook 4.2 Filtering on Multiple Criteria with Boolean Logic", " Chapter 4 Wrangling Rows in R with Filter In this chapter, we will introduce you ways to wrangle rows in R.

Let’s start with a table of the most common error messages, and the likely cause in each case. Note that when reading an error message, there are two parts - the part before the colon, which identifies in which function the error occurred, and the part after the colon, which names the error. A typical error message is something like: Error in as_flextable(.) : object 'errors' not found On the left, you are being told that the error occurred when the as_flextable() function was called. This can be helpful if you have run a long pipeline of functions, as it helps you isolate the problem. On the right, you are being told what the error was. In this case, the function looked for the object errors in the working environment (see your Environment tab at the top right in RStudio), and could not find it. Then we will walk through examples of how to create each error, and how to fix them, one by one. 5.1 The Common Errors Table Examine the error message from R, particularly the part that comes after the colon (:). The error messages listed in the left column will be what appears after the colon (:) .cl-6f910038{border-collapse:collapse;}.cl-6f85ef36{font-family:'Helvetica';font-size:11pt;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;text-decoration:none;color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);background-color:transparent;}.cl-6f861ae2{margin:0;text-align:left;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);padding-bottom:3pt;padding-top:3pt;padding-left:3pt;padding-right:3pt;line-height: 1;background-color:transparent;}.cl-6f867d02{width:54pt;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-6f867d2a{width:54pt;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 2pt solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;}.cl-6f867d34{width:54pt;background-color:transparent;vertical-align: middle;border-bottom: 2pt solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-top: 2pt solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-left: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);border-right: 0 solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.00);margin-bottom:0;margin-top:0;margin-left:0;margin-right:0;} error_messagewhat_it_meanscould not find functionThis usually means that you made a typo in the function name (including Capitalization), or that the package you are intending to use (which contains the function) is not installed (with `install.packages('package_name')`) or loaded (with `library(package)`)object 'object-name' not foundThis usually means that the function looked for an object (like a data frame or a vector) in your working environment (check your Environment pane) and could not find it. This commonly happens when you (1) mistype the name of the object (double-check this, easy to fix), or (2) you did not actually create or save this object to your working environment - confirm by checking your Environment tab at the top right in RStudio.filename does not exist in current working directory ('path/to/working/directory')This usually means one of three things: (1) you mistyped the name of the file, or part of the path, (2) you are not in the directory where the file is, or (3) the file you thought you had saved does not exist (check your Files tab in the lower right pane in RStudio).error in ifThis usually means that you have an *if* statement that is trying to make a branch-point decision, but the logical statement that you wrote is not providing either a TRUE or a FALSE value. The most common reasons are typos in the logical statement, or an NA in one of the underlying values, which yields an NA from the logical statement. You may need to use a `na.rm = TRUE` option in your logical statement. 5.2 Examples of Common Errors and How to fix them It turns out that I forgot to run the code chunk to generate the errors object.

Each package adds new functions and/or data to R, enabling you to do much more in the R and RStudio environment. When you open R, or start a new session, you have only the base version of R available, and it is pretty spartan. You can see how many packages you have available to you by starting RStudio and going to the menu Session/New Session, or Session/Restart R. Each of these will give you a clean workspace to start in. Once you have started a new session, or restarted R, run the following code: print(.packages()) ## [1] &quot;medicaldata&quot; &quot;forcats&quot; &quot;stringr&quot; &quot;dplyr&quot; ## [5] &quot;purrr&quot; &quot;readr&quot; &quot;tidyr&quot; &quot;tibble&quot; ## [9] &quot;ggplot2&quot; &quot;tidyverse&quot; &quot;stats&quot; &quot;graphics&quot; ## [13] &quot;grDevices&quot; &quot;utils&quot; &quot;datasets&quot; &quot;methods&quot; ## [17] &quot;base&quot; You will find that you only have 9 packages available, including base, utils, methods, stats, graphics, grDevices, datasets, devtools, and usethis. In order to use more of the power of R and RStudio, you will need to install packages (a one-time task), and load them (in each session) before use with a library(package_name) function. If you Google a bit for ways to do things in R, you will find many packages that can be helpful. The most strictly validated packages are hosted on CRAN - a mirrored server. There are now over 20,000 packages on CRAN to do various specialized things in R. These were all useful for someone, so they have shared them on CRAN. To install packages from CRAN, you use the function: install.packages(\"package_name\") Notice that the package_name has to be in quotes. These can be single or double quotes. The package_name and install.packages() are case_sensitive like all objects and functions in R, so that something like Install.Packages will not work. Once the package is installed, you keep that in your R library associated with your current major version of R. You will need to update &amp; reinstall packages each time you update a major version of R. R versions are designated with R version #.#.# A change in the third number indicates a minor version change. A change in the first or 2nd number (from R 3.6.2 to 4.0.0, or 4.0.2 to 4.1.0) is a major version upgrade which will require re-installation of packages. Let’s practice installing a package. Run the code below to install the tidyverse package. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) ## ## The downloaded binary packages are in ## /var/folders/93/s18zkv2d4f556fxbjvb8yglc0000gp/T//RtmpI8vFuX/downloaded_packages 6.1.1 Installing Packages from Github Some packages are still in development. These are often in repositories on github, rather than on the CRAN servers. To install these packages, you need to know path to the repository. You can install the medicaldata package from Github. Run the code below to install this package. devtools::install_github(&quot;higgi13425/medicaldata&quot;) ## Using github PAT from envvar GITHUB_PAT ## Skipping install of &#39;medicaldata&#39; from a github remote, the SHA1 (1c039d8b) has not changed since last install. ## Use `force = TRUE` to force installation In contrast, to install.packages, the library() function can work with quotes around the package_name, but they are not required. This is because these packages are already installed in your R library, and are known quantities. In general, known objects in your R environment do not require quotes, and novel things like packages do require quotes. If you re-run print(.packages) at this point, you will not have any more packages. This is because you have installed new packages, but not loaded them. 6.1.2 Problems with Installing Packages 6.1.2.1 R Version Issues Sometimes you may run into a problem installing a package which was developed for a previous version of R. Especially if you have recently upgraded your R version recently, the CRAN version of a package may be a bit behind. This can often be fixed by googling for “github” and “package_name”. This will usually lead you to the github repository for that package, which will have a pathname of “github_username/package_name”. Once you know this, you can use `devtools::install_github(‘github_username/package_name’) to install the newest version of the package, which will usually be compatible with the latest version of R. 6.1.2.2 Installing from Source vs Binaries 6.1.2.3 Dependencies Some packages are dependent on specific versions of other packages, and will ask you to update the other packages during installation. As a general rule, you should say ‘yes’. If you are worried about over-writing an existing package in a way that would break your code in a different project, then that project needs its own project-specific library, which you can create with the {renv} package. 6.1.2.4 Extra-R Dependencies Sometimes packages require (depend upon) software that is not part of the R ecosystem. These will generally give you messages during the install process asking you to install this helper software. Common helper software includes things like Fortran and RJava. Sometimes you will need to go to websites, or use software like Homebrew (on the Mac) to install these extra helper pieces of software. 6.2 Loading Packages with Library Run the code chunk below to load both {tidyverse} and {medicaldata}. Note that the {tidyverse} package is actually a meta-package that contains 8 packages, and each one has its own version number. library(tidyverse) library(medicaldata) Notice that loading tidyverse led to some conflict messages. The dplyr::filter function masks the stats::filter() function. These two packages, {dplyr} and {stats}, both have a function named filter(). The more recently loaded package is assumed to be the default, so if you call a filter() command, R will use dplyr::filter(). If you want to call the stats::filter() command, you have to explicitly use the package::function() format. If you are not sure which package you loaded last, it can be wise to use the explicit format when calling functions in R. The other masked function is lag(). The function dplyr::lag() is masking stats::lag(), as {dplyr} was loaded after {stats}. Most of the time this is not a big difference, but every once in a while a conflict between package functions can get very confusing. When in doubt, use the explicit format, in which you call package::function() to make clear what you mean - dplyr::lag() vs. stats::lag(). Note that it is good practice to load all of your packages needed for an R script or an Rmarkdown (.Rmd) document at the beginning of the script or .Rmd. This allows someone else using your script or Rmd to check whether they have the needed packages installed, and install them if needed. In an Rmarkdown document, this is done in a special setup code chunk near the top of the document. If some of these packages are not on CRAN, it is good practice to add a comment (a statement after a hashtag) on how to install this package. For example, in a setup chunk that loads {tidyverse} and {medicaldata}, it is a good idea to add a comment on how to install {medicaldata}, which is not yet on CRAN. See the example below library(tidyverse) library(medicaldata) # the {medicaldata} package can be installed with devtools::install_github(&#39;higgi13425/medicaldata&#39;) 6.3 Updating R 6.4 Updating RStudio 6.5 Updating Your Packages "],["major-r-updates-where-are-my-packages.html", "Chapter 7 Major R Updates (Where Are My Packages?)", " Chapter 7 Major R Updates (Where Are My Packages?)

But it turns out that most of the truly heinous, embarrassing errors in medical data analysis occur during the process of data wrangling. Imagine being the star of some of these sordid tales. After publishing a paper in JAMA in 2019, the authors share their SAS code on Github, and an interested critic noticed that they listed data for 73,000 kidney transplants in the US in one year. But someone familiar with the UNOS data knew that there are about 280,000 kidney transplants per year. During a merge step between two databases, SAS silently over-wrote much of the original data. This discovery led to a retraction of the paper and re-analysis, demonstraing a much smaller effect size. (Gander JC, Zhang X, Ross K, et al.

Retracted and replaced Nov 12, 2018. JAMA. 2018;320(22):2335-2343.), the authors realized that they had miscoded the treatment arms. For their logistic regression analysis, they had to recode the treatment arms from 1 and 2 to 0 and 1. Unfortunately, they flipped the values, and interpreted their results as beneficial. When they realized that the mis-coding changed the result from beneficial to harmful, they reported it to the journal and retracted the paper. After publishing a report on Best Practices for In-Hospital Cardiac Arrest in JAMA Cardiology, the authors found coding errors in their data. 9 hospitals of 130 had been misclassified, changing some of their associations.

Before we plunge in, I would like to make one point of warning. It is quite common in a multiple-arm randomized controlled trial to compare the distribution of particular baseline characteristics of the subjects between arms with a p value, usually in a column at the far right. This is silly, as this produces a whole column of p values, corresponding to the multiple comparisons performed. With 20 comparisons, by chance, you are likely to get one or more “significant” p values. These are not helpful or meaningful, and are considered bad statistical practice. Let me quote the CONSORT guidelines on the publications of clinical trials. “Unfortunately significance tests of baseline differences are still common; they were reported in half of 50 RCTs published in leading general journals in 1997. Such significance tests assess the probability that observed baseline differences could have occurred by chance; however, we already know that any differences are caused by chance. Tests of baseline differences are not necessarily wrong, just illogical. Such hypothesis testing is superfluous and can mislead investigators and their readers. Rather, comparisons at baseline should be based on consideration of the prognostic strength of the variables measured and the size &gt;of any chance imbalances that have occurred.” CONSORT STATEMENT Despite this, some journals and editors still ask for these p values. Please resist, and quote the CONSORT statement. If you must do this, please do it only under duress. 10.1 Making Table One 10.1.1 The tableby function in the arsenal package 10.1.2 The gtsummary package with flextable This is a newer approach which offers many of the same features as tableby. The gtsummary package is a companion to/built upon the gt package, (“gt” for grammar of tables), which is supported by RStudio. The gtsummary package, like gt, is designed to produce nice html output with lots of nice formatting. However, as a nice bonus, gtsummary includes a neat function as_flextable, which converts your resulting table into a flextable, which can be knit to a Microsoft Word Document or a Powerpoint presentation with Rmarkdown. This means that you can make a table once, and be able to produce output in HTML for webpages, Microsoft Word for manuscripts, and MS Powerpoint for presentations from the same file without any conversion issues. The only question is how and when you prefer to format your table. Both gt and flextable have great options for formatting your tables. You can do this in gt, then do as_flextable, or you can convert to a flextable first, then do your formatting. You can choose based on your comfort and familiarity with flextable vs. gt. Both have excellent explanatory websites, with flextable here and gtsummary here. 10.1.3 Example of how to build a Table 1 with gtsummary In the window below, you can: Expand the example below to View in full screen by clicking the four arrows icon (Esc to return to small version).

These outcomes can be measured with dichotomous outcomes like death or hospitalization, but continuous outcomes like systolic blood pressure, endoscopic score, or ejection fraction are more commonly available, and provide more statistical power, and usually require a smaller sample size. There is a tendency in clinical research to focus on dichotomous outcomes, even to the point of converting continuous measures to dichotomous ones (aka “dichotomania”, see Frank Harrell comments here), for fear of detecting and acting upon a small change in a continuous outcome that is not clinically meaningful. While this can be a concern, especially in very large, over-powered studies, it can be addressed by aiming for a continuous difference that is at least as large as one that many clinicians agree (a priori) is clinically important (the MCID, or Minimum Clinically Important Difference). The most common comparison of two groups with a continuous outcome is to look at the means or medians, and determine whether the available evidence suggests that these are equal (the null hypothesis). This can be done for means with Student’s t-test. Let’s start by looking at the cytomegalovirus data set. This includes data on 64 patients who received bone marrow stem cell transplant, and looks at their time to activation of CMV (cytomegalovirus). In the code chunk below, we group the data by donor cmv status (donor.cmv), and look at the mean time to CMV activation (time.to.cmv variable). Run the code (using the green arrow at the top right of the code chunk below) to see the difference in time to CMV activation in months between groups. Try out some other grouping variables in the group_by statement, in place of donor.cmv. Consider variables like race, sex, and recipient.cmv. Edit the code and run it again with the green arrow at the top right. # insert libraries in each chunk as if independent library(tidyverse) library(medicaldata) cytomegalovirus %&gt;% group_by(sex) %&gt;% summarize(mean_time2cmv = mean(time.to.cmv)) -&gt; summ summ ## # A tibble: 2 x 2 ## sex mean_time2cmv ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 0 13.7 ## 2 1 12.7 That seems like a big difference for donor.cmv, between 13.7303333 months and 12.7441176 months. And it makes theoretical sense that having a CMV positive donor is more likely to be associated with early activation of CMV in the recipient. But is it a significant difference, one that would be very unlikely to happen by chance? That depends on things like the number of people in each group, and the standard deviation in each group. That is the kind of question you can answer with a t-test, or for particularly skewed data like hospital length of stay or medical charges, a Wilcoxon test. 11.1 Common Problem Comparing two groups Mean or median vs. expected Two arms of study - independent Pre and post / spouse and partner / left vs right arm – paired groups Are the means significantly different?

The command line is a simple Terminal window with a prompt at which you can type commands, And do primitive but powerful things to your files. The UNIX computing environment was developed in the 1960s, and is still beloved and fetishized by brogrammers, who believe you are not truly a programmmer if you can’t code from the command line. This is silly. The major attraction to UNIX in the 1960s is that it was much better than punch cards. Which isn’t saying much. We have had 60 years of software advancement and user interface improvements, so we really should not have to put up with the inherent user hostility of the UNIX environment. UNIX is an early operating system, which is built around a ‘kernel’ which executes operating system commands, and a ‘shell’ which interprets your commands and sends them to the kernel for execution. The most common shell these days is named ‘bash’, which is a silly recursive brogrammer joke. You will sometimes see references to shell scripts or shell or bash programming. These are the same thing as command line programming. UNIX is a common under-the-hood language across many computers today, as the Apple iOS is built on top of UNIX, and the various versions of the LinuxOS are built on a UNIX-like kernel, with a similar command shell. The command line is often the least common denominator between different pieces of open-source software that were not designed to work together. It can occasionally be helpful to build a data pipeline from mismatched parts. However, there is a lot of low-quality user-hostile command line work involved to get it done, often referred to as “command-line bullshittery”. This is a common bottleneck that slows scientific productivity, and there is a vigorous discussion of it on the interwebs here and here (counterpoint). Essentially, some argue that it is largely a waste of time and effort, while others see it as a valuable learning experience, like doing least squares regression by hand with a pencil. Running R from the command line is a bit like spending a day tuning your car’s engine by yourself. There is a case to be made that this will improve the efficiency and performance of your car, but it is also usually more efficient to pay someone else to do it, unless you are a car expert with a lot of free time. 12.2 Why run R from the command line? You can run R from the command line. It has none of the bells and whistles, nor any of the user conveniences of the RStudio Interactive Developer Environment (IDE). But it is how R was originally expected to be used when it was developed back in 2000 in New Zealand. Running R from the command line allows you to do powerful things, like process multiple files at once, which can be handy when you have multiple files of sequencing data from distinct observations, or you have a multistep data wrangling pipeline with several slow steps. For many years, this was the only way to easily apply code across multiple files to build a complex data pipeline. This is much less true today, with tools to handle file paths like the {here} and {fs} packages, run Python scripts from R with the {reticulate} package, run C++ scripts with Rcpp, and run bash, python, SQL, D3, and Stan scripts from Rmarkdown. You can use the {drake} package to manage multi-step data pipelines in different languages (similar to make). But some labs have been doing things at the command line for years, and find it hard to change. 12.3 How do you get started? First, you need to open a terminal window. And to do that, you need to find it. This is akin to getting under the hood of a car, and computer makers don’t exactly encourage it. 12.3.1 On a Mac Go to Finder/Applications/Utilities/Terminal 12.3.2 On a Windows PC Go to Applications/Terminal 12.4 The Yawning Blackness of the Terminal Window So, you have managed to open a terminal window, which has a standard UNIX prompt, ending in something like % or $. Not terribly helpful, is it? The bash shell is waiting for you to enter a command. No user interface for you! Let’s start with a simple one, which can’t do any harm. Run the command below: whoami whoami ## peterhiggins Remember that UNIX started out as an operating system for terminals, and knowing who was logged in was a helpful thing. You can string together two commands with a semicolon between them. Try the following: whoami;date ## peterhiggins ## Sun Dec 27 20:53:44 EST 2020 OK, fine. This is sort of helpful. It was really important when you were on a terminal and paying by the minute for time on a mainframe back in 1969. And, on occasion, if you will need to use an entire computer cluster to run a script (or scripts) on a lot of data, you will likely have to use some of this command line knowledge. You can even schedule jobs (scripts) to run when your time is scheduled on the cluster with cron and crontab. At this point, it would be helpful to open a window with your Documents folder, and keep it side by side with the window in which you are reading this e-book. We will start working with files and directories, and it is helpful to see changes in your file/folder structure in real time. As we run commands in the bash shell, check them against what you see in the folder window. You may find that some files (dotfiles, starting with a period) are hidden from the user to prevent problems that occur when these are deleted. 12.5 Where Are We? OK, let’s start looking at files and directories. Start with the pwd command, which does not stand for password, but for print working directory. Run the code below in your Terminal window. pwd ## /Users/peterhiggins/Documents/RCode/rmrwr-book You can see the full path to your current directory. This can be a bit obscure if you are just looking at your folder structure, particularly at the beginning of the path. Fortunately, the {here} package handles a lot of this for you when you are working in Rstudio projects. We think of the directory as a tree, with a root - in this case, Users, and various branches as you build out folders and subfolders. We can move up and down the folders of the directory paths with the cd command, for change directory. Try this command in your Terminal Window, and see if you can figure out what it does. cd .. It changes the directory up one level closer to the root directory. It is straightforward to go up the directory tree, as each folder only has one parent. But it is tricky to go down the directory tree, as there are many possible branches/children, and you do not inherently know the names of these branches. We need to list the contents of your current directory with ls to know what is there. Try the ls command in your Terminal window cd /Users/peterhiggins/Documents/; ls ## 1FQ_Crohn&#39;s Disease_23Oct2020 (002).doc ## 2020-Jun-05 AGA IMIBD meeting notest.docx ## 2021 AGA Invited Speaker Session Basic Hybrid Example.pdf ## 2021.Higgins AGA Distinguished Clinician.CO.docx ## A is for Allspice.2.0.docx ## A is for Allspice.docx ## ABT263_HIO_report_toWord.docx ## AGA IMIBD ## AGA IMIBD Councilor Career Discussion Guide.docx ## AGA IMIBD Webinar Outline.docx ## AIBD CAM Higgins.pdf ## AIBD CAM Higgins.pptx ## AIBD SoMe Higgins.pdf ## AIBD SoMe Higgins.pptx ## AIBD agreement.docx ## AIBD20Template.pptx ## AMAG DDW Clear draft_PDRH comments.docx ## APG1244_Milestone_report.docx ## ASUC_UC_protocol_comments_2020.docx ## A_Woodward_Score Sheet_PDRH.docx ## Accounts and Access (1) (1).docx ## Advice for participants in webinars.docx ## Animation of NSAID.pptx ## BKochar_Frailty.pdf ## BM recommendation.docx ## Beginners_GuideToR.pdf ## Biosketch for K.pptx ## Biosketch_2020_Higgins_ClinResIBD_biosketch.doc ## Brazil.ItineraryNov2015.docx ## Butter BCS Chicken.docx ## CAS.K.candidate.background_SB_PDRH.docx ## CAS.T32.Project.Description-JS.docx ## CAS.career.goals.obj.development.training_PDRH.docx ## CC360_The Risk of SARS.R1.docx ## CC360_The Risk of SARS.docx ## CCF IBD Webcast 2020 Draft Deck_For Review.pptx ## CCFA EIC Candidate Interview Questions (candidates) jobin[1].doc ## CDC_proposal1.1.docx ## CLARE STOCKS.docx ## COVID Trials Feasibility ## CaltechCampus Tour &amp; Information Session.webarchive ## Cancel Appt Epic.ppt ## Causal.png ## CellDeath_DDW_2021_ISS.pdf ## Chu RPG Review_PDRH.docx ## Clare Investment Summary.docx ## Council Conversations Author Chat Guide.docx ## Coursera_Programming in R Notes.docx ## CoverLetterPlus.pptx ## Crash&amp;Burn_ScriptV2_100318 copy.pdf ## DataCamp Courses by Topic.docx ## DeEscalationACG2016.pptx ## Demographics.pdf ## Documents.Rproj ## DrHiggins IBD Data Request.xlsx ## Draft Postop IBD Surgery Care Protocols v2_SERedit.docx ## ECCO 2016 Amsterdam Schedule.docx ## ECCO 2019 UC PRO SS Abstract D1f_JP_UA_YO_AM_PDRH.docx ## ECCO2016Lycera30937.pptx ## Effect of medications on the recurrence of cancer in IBD patients.docx ## Electrical engineering interview questions.docx ## FDAtofaResponse.docx ## FFMI Kickstart-FinalReport 5-20-16-LJ.docx ## FITBITProtocol_28NOV2016_AbbVie.docx ## FITBITProtocol_4DEC2016_AbbVie.docx ## FMT_DDW_2021_ISS.pdf ## FibrosisIBDCedars2016.pptx ## Figures-KC-JAMA.pptx ## Finance and Retirement Plans.docx ## Financial Priorities.docx ## Garmin Notes.docx ## General Social Media Tips.docx ## General thoughts about query letters.docx ## Getting Started with REDCap.docx ## Git for MDs_2.pptx ## GitHub ## Github for MDs_1.pptx ## Glover_RPG_Review_PDRH.docx ## GoToMeeting Chats ## GradPartyHigginsInvites.xlsx ## HPI-5016 IBD Patient Contact Info.xlsx ## HS movie.docx ## Higgins AGA Webinar Slides.pptx ## Higgins Bio.docx ## Higgins New IBD.pptx ## Higgins Refractory Proctitis.pptx ## Higgins biosketch2015KRao.doc ## Higgins biosketch2016KRao.doc ## Higgins-peter.jpg ## HigginsACGMidwest2019_PerioperativeIBD.pptx ## Higgins_LOS_IBDBiobank_Shah_Nusrat_2019.docx ## Higgins_UM_CME_Pregnancy in IBD.pptx ## How To Log in to IBD Server.docx ## How To Log in to RStudio Server for HigginsLab.docx ## How To Log in to RStudio Server for Shiny.docx ## IBD 2020 -

In your Terminal window: change the directory to the Powerpoint directory list the contents of this folder cd /Users/peterhiggins/Documents/Powerpoint; ls ## 2016IBDClinTrialsforMDsDearborn.pptx ## 2016IntegratedDeckorMDsGB.pptx ## 2019 SCSG GI Symposium IBD SoA - Read-Only.pptx ## BE LGD Dearborn 2016.04.12.pptx ## Getting Started in RStudio.pptx ## Higgins Microbiota for IBD Patient Ed.pptx ## HigginsDec2018AJG_SmokingStatus.pptx ## IBDUpdate.pptx ## Integrated Slide Deck Dearborn 2016.04.12.pptx ## MER Stress Management Dearborn 4-14.pptx ## MichiganMedicine-IBDTemplate.potx ## PDRH RCAR 2020.pptx ## PennThioMTX2017Higgins.pptx ## Pregnancy in IBD.pptx ## Regenbogen CRS for GI CME Course2016.pptx ## Senior Slide Show.pptx ## ThomsonRectalStumpComplicationsIBD2_13.pptx ## UEGweek2020.pptx ## UMHS Talk- Moving Beyond AntiTNF 4-2016 FINAL v2.pptx ## Vertebrate Animals for K.pptx ## VirtualPtEdMar2020.v2.pptx ## Writers Room.pptx ## ibd_meds_surgery_metan.pptx Great! You moved to a new directory and listed it. Now we will get fancy, and make a new directory within this directory with the mkdir command. Try this in your Terminal window: pwd; mkdir new_files; ls You have now made a new directory (folder) within the previous directory, named new_files. Verify this in your Documents folder. You can now change to this directory and list the contents (it should be empty). Try this out in your Terminal Window (note edit the cd command to your own directory path). cd /Users/peterhiggins/Documents/Powerpoint/new_files; ls Note that you can abbreviate the current directory with ., so that you could have also used cd ./new_files You can create a new (empty) file in this directory with the touch command. Sometimes you need to create a new file, then write data to it. Try this out touch file_name; ls You can also create a file with data inside it with the cat &gt; command. Type in the following lines into your Terminal window. When complete, type control-D to be done and return to the Terminal prompt. cat stands for concatenate. cat &gt; file2.txt cat1 cat2 cat3 Now you can list the contents of this file with the cat command below. Give this a try cat file2.txt You can also list the directory of your new_files folder with ls to see the new folder contents. Try this ls Note that you don’t need to use the Terminal to run bash commands. You can do this from an Rmarkdown file. Take a moment to run pwd in your Terminal, to get the current directory. Now open Rstudio, and a new Rmarkdown document. Copy the path to the current directory from the Terminal. Switch back to the Rmarkdown document. Select one of the R code chunks (note the {r} at the top) and delete it. Now click on the Insert dropdown at the top of the document, and insert a Bash chunk. Now add UNIX commands (separated by a semicolon), like cd (paste in path here); pwd; ls; cat file2.txt Then run this chunk. Now you can run terminal commands directly from Rmarkdown! 12.6 Cleaning Up OK, now we are done with the file file2.txt and the directory new_files. Let’s get rid of them with rm (for removing files) and rmdir for removing directories. In order, we will - Make sure we are in the right directory - remove the file with rm file2.txt - go up one level of the directory with cd .. - remove the directory with rmdir new_files Give this a try pwd; rm file2.txt; cd ..; rmdir new_files Verify all of this in your Documents window. This is great. But you can imagine a situation in which you mistakenly rm a file (or directory) that you actually needed. Unlike your usual user interface, when a file is removed at the command line, it is gone. It is not in the trash folder. It is gone. There is something to be said for modern user interfaces, which are built for humans, who occasionally make mistakes. Sometimes we do want files or folders back. 12.7 Other helpful file commands Here are some file commands worth knowing cat filename - to print out whole file to your monitor less filename - to print out the first page of a file, and you can scroll through each page one at a time head filename - print first 10 lines of a file tail filename - print last 10 lines of a file cp file1 file2 - copy file1 to file2 mv file1.txt file.2.txt file3.txt new_folder - move 3 files to a new folder 12.8 What about R? So now you can get around directories, and find your files in the Terminal window, but you really want to run R. You can launch an R session from the Terminal Window (if you have R installed on your computer) by typing the letter R at the Terminal prompt Launch R R You get the usual R intro, including version number, and the R&gt; prompt. Now you can run R in interactive mode with available datasets, or your own datasets. Try a few simple commands with the mtcars dataset. Give the examples below a try. You can use q() to quit back to the terminal (and reply “n” to not save the workplace image). head(mtcars) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am ## Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 ## Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 ## Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 ## Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 ## gear carb ## Mazda RX4 4 4 ## Mazda RX4 Wag 4 4 ## Datsun 710 4 1 ## Hornet 4 Drive 3 1 ## Hornet Sportabout 3 2 ## Valiant 3 1 mtcars %&gt;% filter(mpg &gt; 25) %&gt;% select(starts_with(&#39;m&#39;)|starts_with(&#39;c&#39;)) ## mpg cyl carb ## Fiat 128 32.4 4 1 ## Honda Civic 30.4 4 2 ## Toyota Corolla 33.9 4 1 ## Fiat X1-9 27.3 4 1 ## Porsche 914-2 26.0 4 2 ## Lotus Europa 30.4 4 2 12.9 What about just a few lines of R? Sometimes you will want to call R, run some code, and be done with R. You can call R, run a few lines, and quit in one go. Just add the flag -e (for evaluate) to the call to R, and put the R commands in quotes. Try the example below (note that this will not work if you are still in R - be sure you are back in the terminal with the % or $ prompt) R -e &quot;head(mtcars)&quot; or this example - note that single or double quotes does not matter - as long as they match. Try this R -e &#39;install(palmerpenguins)&#39; You can also string together several commands with the semicolon between them. Try the example below. R -e &#39;library(palmerpenguins);data(penguins);tail(penguins)&#39; 12.10 Running an R Script from the Terminal Now we are stepping up a level - you have an R script that you have carefully created and saved as the myscript.R file. How do you run this from the Terminal? This is easy - just call the Rscript command with your file name. Pick out a short R file you have written, make sure you are in the right directory where the file is, and use it as in the example below. Rscript myscript.R This launches R, runs your script, saves resulting output (if your script includes save or ggsave commands), closes R, and sends you back to the Terminal. Very simple. 12.11 Rendering an Rmarkdown file from the Terminal This is a little different, as you can’t just run an Rmarkdown file. Normally you would use the dropdown button to knit your file from Rstudio. But you can use the rmarkdown::render command to render your files to HTML, PDF, Word, Powerpoint, etc. Pick out a simple Rmd file like output_file.Rmd below, make sure you are in the right directory where the file is, and try something like the example below. Note that this is one case where nesting different types of quotes (single vs. double) can come in handy. It helps to use single quotes around your filename and double quotes around the rmarkown::render command. Try it out Rscript -e &quot;rmarkdown::render(&#39;output_file.Rmd&#39;)&quot; So there you have it! Just enough to get you started with R from the command line.

Note that each chapter should start with a level 1 header, which will be the title of the chapter. Each level 1 header starts with a single hashtag, then a space, then the text of the title. You can save draft chapters without necessarily publishing them to the final book. They will not be included until you list them in your _bookdown.yml file. After saving and knitting each chapter successfully, the finalized chapters can be included in the book build, and ordered, by adding them to the _bookdown.yml file, in between index.Rmd, and io98-title-holder.Rmd. 13.6 Chapter Names The names of each chapter follow the convention, io##-Topic.Rmd. This is so that they will alphabetically follow index.Rmd and largely be in order. 13.7 When a Chapter is Ready for Sharing Add the new chapter to the list of chapters in order in _bookdown.yml, somewhere in between - index.Rmd and - io98-title_holder.Rmd 13.8 Building the Book Render the book with bookdown::render_book('index.html') 13.9 Publishing the Book Publish the book with bookdown::publish_book(account = 'pdr_higgins') Then commit the changes and push to Github Within a minute or three, the updated book will appear at: https://bookdown.org/pdr_higgins/rmrwr/ More details can be found at: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/rstudio-connect.html and at https://bookdown.org/home/about/ "],["title-holder.html", "Title holder", " Title holder "],["references-1.html", "References", " References "]]
