# Wrangling Rows in R with Filter
In this chapter, we will introduce you ways to wrangle rows in R. You will often want to focus your analysis on particular observations, or rows, in your dataset. This chapter will show you how to include the rows you want, and exclude the rows you don't want. 
Once your data wrangling and data validation is done, you will be ready for data analysis.
