# Time Series data with the Tidyverts Packages
Fun text here. 
All kinds of crazy examples.
Time series with data from influenza pandemic of 1918-19, perhaps.
This is a book for anyone in the medical field interested in analyzing the data available to them to better understand health, disease, or delivery of care. This could include nurses, dieticians, psychologists, and PhDs in related fields, as well as medical students, residents, fellows, or doctors in practice.     
I expect that most learners will be using this book in their spare time at night and on weekends, as the medical school curriculum is already packed full, and there is no room to add skills in reproducible research to the standard curriculum. This book is designed for self-teaching, and many hints and solutions will be provided to avoid roadblocks and frustration.
