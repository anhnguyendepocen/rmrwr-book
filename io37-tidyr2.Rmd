## Review: What is Tidy Data?
 Tidy data is rectangular (rows by columns) data formatted to fit 3 main rules:
 
 1. Each row is a unique observation.
 2. Each column contains a single variable.
 3. Each cell contains only one piece of data - a value or count.
 
![Tidy Data Characteristics](tidy-1.png) 
 
<br>and different kinds of observations (usually recorded on distinct clinical report forms, or CRFs) are usually stored in distinct tables.
 
### Tidy data is helpful because: 
 
 1. Most tidyverse and tidyverse-adjacent packages are designed to work on data in tidy data format, and output results in tidy data format.
 2. This standardized format allows packages and functions to work together, taking output from one function as input to another function.
 3. This allows "chaining" or piping (%>%) of functions together to allow you to do more powerful, more complex things with your data quickly and easily, with no friction between functions and data-processing steps.
 4. This allows you to focus on the analysis you want to do, rather than the mechanics of the functions and the data formats.

Tidy data is particularly helpful for R, which treats each column as a vector, because a tidy layout ensures that values of variables (vectors) from the same observation are always matched.

Tidying is one of the key preparation steps in a Data Science workflow, after Importing and before Transforming.

## Tidying Data
Today we will review *pivot_longer* and *separate()*, and
learn about new *tidyr* functions, 

1. *pivot_wider()*, which does the reverse of *pivot_longer()*
2. *unite()*, which does the opposite of *separate()*
3. *separate_rows*, which addresses when you have a variable number of multiple values of the same type in one cell. One common examples is a list of medications (i.e. HCTZ, claritin, propanolol, enalapril) in a single cell.
4. *uncount*, which takes a summary of counts, and returns these to individual rows of observations (the reverse of *count*)
5. *nest()*, which allows you to group data by categorical factor variables and collect the remaining variables into a dataframe (in a list column!) for each row. This allows you to do complex operations (i.e. linear regressions) on each dataframe.
6. *unnest()* which restores your nested data to individual observations.

### 1. Review of pivot_longer
Let's start with a review of *pivot_longer*. Take a look at the included pivotdx data on 6 recently hospitalized patients with multiple diagnoses by running the code chunk below.

```{r pivotdx}
name <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Cassie", "Doug", "Ellen", "Frank")
studyid <- 1:6
dx1 <- c("J15.0", "J13", "J15.7", "J18.9", "J13", "J18.9")
dx2 <- c("K51.8", "K51.50", "K51.911", "K50.80", "K50.0", "K50.90")
dx3 <- c("Z92.25", "Z92.25", "Z92.25", "Z92.25", "Z92.25", "Z92.25")
dx4 <- c("D68.69", "D68.69", NA, "D68.69", "D68.69", "D68.69")
dx5 <- c(NA, "N17.0", NA, "N17.0", "N17.0", "N17.0")
dx6 <- c(NA, "I82.409", NA, "I82.409", "I82.409", NA)
dx7 <- c(NA, "F33.0", NA, "N39.0", NA, NA)
pivotdx <- data.frame(studyid, name, dx1, dx2, dx3, dx4, dx5, dx6, dx7)

pivotdx
```
This is a common data format for hospitalizations and patient encounters.
Everyone has at least one ICD-10 diagnosis, but some have as many as 15, while others may only have 3.
This is untidy because the diagnoses should be in a single column, dx.

Your challenge is to use *pivot_longer* to tidy this dataset.

Remember that the *pivot_longer()* function uses four main arguments

1. cols =  sets which columns you want to group together for pivoting to longer format
2. names_to = what the new column name will be in which to collect and keep the information from the old pivoted column names (often a visit number, week, or other time point)
3. names_prefix = what part of the old, pivoted column names is repeated and should be removed
4. values_to = the name of the column in which to keep the values from the cells of the pivoted columns

and when you have NAs, you want to add the argument <br>
values_drop_na = TRUE <br>
to the pivot_longer() function.

Edit the code block below to tidy the pivotdx data and assign the result to tidydx.
Assign the diagnosis number to dx_num.

```{r fix pivotdx}
pivotdx %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("dx"),
               names_to = "dx_num",
               names_prefix = "dx",
               values_to = "diagnosis",
               values_drop_na = TRUE)  ->
tidydx

tidydx
```

### 2. Review of separate()

Take a look at the blood pressure data by running to code chunk below. Edit this code to separate the bp data into sbp and dbp variables.

Remember that the *separate()* function has 3 arguments: <br> 

1. the column that needs to be separated, col = "column2separate"
2. the columns that the new data will go into, into = c("newcol1", "newcol2")
3. The separator, sep = "-" (whatever the separator text is, in quotes) <br> 

Edit the code chunk below, replacing the *head()* function and using the *separate()* function to replace the bp column with sbp and dbp.

```{r fix bp}
data %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("bp"),
               names_to = "visit_num",
               names_prefix = "bp",
               values_to = "bp") %>% 
  select(studyid, visit_num, bp) ->
bpdata

bpdata %>% 
  separate(col = "bp",
           into = c("sbp", "dbp"),
           sep = "/")
```


### 3. Use separate_rows to tidy a medications column.

It is common to have a data query that results in a list of medications in a single common, often separated by commas.
Each patient will have a variable number of medications, and you want a tidy single column of medications, which requires the *separate_rows()* function.
 
The *separate_rows()* function has 3 arguments: <br> 

1. the dataframe (if not piped in already)
2. the name of the column or columns that need to be separated, using the syntax from dplyr::select() - i.e. unquoted list with commas, column1:column4, starts_with(med), etc.
3. The separator, sep = "-" (whatever the separator text is, in quotes, default is comma) 
4. convert =TRUE  will convert data types if needed <br> 

Edit the code chunk below to make the medications column tidy.
 
 
```{r}
name <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Cassie", "Doug", "Ellen", "Frank")
studyid <- 1:6
medications <- c("propanolol, HCTZ, aspirin", 
                 "enalapril, aspirin, clonidine, sumatriptan", 
                 "aspirin, ramipril, HCTZ, hydrocortisone", 
                 "atorvastatin, aspirin, synthroid", 
                 "albuterol, oxycodone, pravastatin, synthroid, omeprazole",                   "crestor, lantus, HCTZ, lyrica, januvia")

meds <- data.frame(studyid, name, medications)

meds %>% 
  separate_rows("medications",
                sep = ",")
```

### 4. Using *uncount()*
Uncount takes a dataframe that is a summary of counts, and returns these to individual rows of observations (the reverse of *count*).

Run the code chunk below to review the sex and primary diagnoses of patients in two weeks of a busy IBD clinic.

To return this summary table (made with group_by and count) to individual tidy observations, use the *uncount()* function.

The three arguments for uncount are

1. the data frame (unless piped in)
2. the weights for each group (often a variable named count or n)
3. .id = A string if you want to generate a unique id for each observation. The string will be the name of the new column, i.e.   .id ="studyid"

Note that *uncount()* will automatically generate rownames consisting of category # and the number in that group (i.e. 3.46). These can be moved to a useful column by piping the result of uncount() to the function <br>
*rownames_to_column(var = "rowname")* from the *tibble* package
<br>
Try adding this line to your code

Alternatively, you can pipe your result into <br>
remove_rownames()

```{r uncount}
library(tibble)
sex <- c("Male", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Male", "Female")
primarydx <- c("Crohn's disease", "Ulcerative colitis", "Microscopic Colitis")
count <- c(58, 61, 71, 59, 19, 84)

counts <- data.frame(sex, primarydx, count)

counts %>% 
  uncount(count, .id ="studyid") %>% 
  rownames_to_column(var = "number")
```

### 5. Nesting some of your data

The *nest()* function allows you to group data by categorical factor variables and collect the remaining variables into a dataframe (in a list column!) for each row. This allows you to do complex operations (i.e. linear regressions) on each dataframe.

As our first example, let's see how this works with the gapminder dataset.
Run the code below, then view (in the Environment tab, by clicking on the dataset names) both the original gapminder dataset, and gap_nested to see the difference from nesting. 
<br>
Click on the dataframes in the individual cells of the gap_nested dataframe to see how they actually contain their own dataframes (inside a column) for that particular country.
<br>
The dataframes are nested inside a special kind of column, called a list-column, within the gap_nested dataframe.
<br>
This is a bit like Russian nesting dolls. If you glimpse(gap_nested), you will see that this column has the type *list<df[,4]>* meaning that it contains dataframes with varying numbers of rows and 4 columns.
<br>
This nested data format allows you to do complex things, like generate linear models for all 142 countries in gap_nested to show the relationship between gdpPercap and lifeExp (life expectancy) in each country, and store the slopes and intercepts as variables in the gap_nested dataframe.

```{r gapminder}
library(gapminder)
gapminder <- gapminder::gapminder
gapminder

gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country, continent) %>% 
  nest() ->
gap_nested

gap_nested
```

In the chunk below, we will illustrate how to use the nested dataframes to make 142 linear models.
Run it to see the result.

```{r, fig.width=12, fig.height=10}
library(purrr)
library(broom)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
gap_nested  %>% 
  mutate(model = map(data, ~lm(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, data = .x))) ->
models

models %>% mutate(glance  = map(model, glance),
         tidy    = map(model, tidy),
         augment = map(model, augment),
         rsq     = map_dbl(glance, "r.squared")) ->
models2

models2 %>% 
  arrange(desc(rsq)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= fct_reorder(country, rsq), y = rsq, color= continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  coord_flip()
  
```


### 6. Unnest simply reverses the nesting step
This restores your dataframe to a tidy state, with one observation per row. 
Try this out with gap_nested below.

The arguments for unnest have good defaults, so you can often run *unnest(dataframe)* without any other arguments.

But it is possible to use 
.preserve = list-column_name (usually data) to keep particular list columns while unnesting the rest of them (if you have more than one list column)
.drop = TRUE is the default, to drop all list columns after they are unnested.

Edit the code below to unnest gap_nested. <br>
You should get the original gapminder dataset back.

```{r}
gap_nested %>% 
  unnest()
```

## Challenge round!
you have been provided (below) with a messy clinical dataset with longitudinal repeated data. Your job is to use your new tidying skills to tidy this dataset. This data is from a hypothetical 8 week study of 6 patients with Crohn's disease treated with Amazingmab who get a survey (CDAI - Crohn's Disease Activity Index) score at 0 and 8 weeks, and and endoscopic score (SES-CD - Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease) at 0 and 8 weeks. They also vary in whether or not they have ileal or colonic (or both) involvement of active Crohn's disease at baseline.

You should end up with 9 columns for:

1. studyid
2. name
3. enrollment month
4. enrollment year
5. ileal involvement
6. colonic involvement
7. week
8. CDAI
9. SES_CD <br>
<br>
Run the code chunk below to take a look at the data, then get started on _*tidying your data!*_


```{r newdata}
name <- c("Alice", "Bob", "Cassie", "Doug", "Ellen", "Frank")
studyid <- 1:6
CDAIwk0 <- c(255, 310, 388, 274, 410, 375)
CDAIwk8 <- c(110, 140, 175, 122, 180, 90)
SES_CDwk0 <- c(25, 14, 19, 21, 22, 17)
SES_CDwk8 <- c(7, 4, 6, 8, 7, 5)
ileocolonic <- c('0_1', '1_1', '1_0', '1_1', '1_0', '1_1')
enroll_month <- c("May-18", "Jun-18", 'Sep-18', 'Jan-19', 'Feb-19', 'Apr-19')

challenge <- data.frame(studyid, name, enroll_month, ileocolonic, CDAIwk0, SES_CDwk0, CDAIwk8, SES_CDwk8)

challenge
```

```{r}
challenge %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("CDAI"),
               names_to = "Week",
               values_to = "CDAI",
               names_prefix = "CDAIwk") %>% 
  select(studyid, Week, CDAI) ->
cdai_data

challenge %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("SES"),
               names_to = "Week",
               values_to = "SES_CD",
               names_prefix = "SES_CDwk") %>% 
  select(studyid, Week, SES_CD) ->
ses_data

challenge %>% 
  select(studyid:ileocolonic) %>% 
  left_join(cdai_data) %>% 
  left_join(ses_data) %>% 
  separate(col = "enroll_month", into = c("month", "year"), sep = "-") %>% 
  separate(col = "ileocolonic", into = c("ileal", "colonic"), sep = "_") 

```
