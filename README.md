This is the Github repository for Reproducible Medical Research with R, a book about working toward more reproducible medical research using R and associated tools, particularly those developed by RStudio.

The book itself can be found [here](https://rmrwr-book.netlify.com/)

## Goals

Making it easier to share data.     
Making it easier to create literate code, and share this code.     
Training the next generation of medical researchers to use ROpenSci tools, open research, and to encourage others to evaluate their data and their code to improve it.     
## Secondary Gains

A repository of Things I have Learned (TILs) that I might want to reference in the future.     
A repository of things I want to teach and share with medical research trainees.
